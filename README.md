# Resume

I'm building my resume with a static site generator (eleventy) and tailwind now because
I can't be bothered to deal with latex anymore.

```
npm install
npm run start
```

Edit resume content in `index.json` and the layout and styling in `index.njk`.

Then open http://localhost:8080 and Save as PDF.
